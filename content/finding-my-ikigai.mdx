# Finding My Ikigai: How Government Technology Became My Passion

## Understanding Ikigai

Ikigai is a Japanese concept that represents the intersection of four key elements:
- What you love
- What you're good at
- What the world needs
- What you can be paid for

My decade+ journey at the Bureau of Labor Statistics became an unexpected path to discovering my personal ikigai.

## What I Love: Technology and Problem-Solving

From the beginning, I was interested in Tech / Computers , driven by a desire to find solutions to  problems. 
I didn't exactly know where/how I could fit in into the world. But that was the general direction I wanted to take. 
Some of the projects which I worked on weren't just technical challenges‚Äîthey were opportunities to transform complicated processes into intuitive experiences.

## What I'm Good At: Software Engineering and Innovation

My skills went beyond coding. I excelled at:
- Understanding complex business requirements
- Designing user-friendly interfaces
- Creating scalable, flexible systems
- Bridging technology with human needs

The [IDCF Suite of applications](https://idcf.bls.gov) perfectly exemplified this‚Äîwe didn't just build a tool, we reimagined how survey management could work.

## What the World Needs: Reliable Public Infrastructure

Government technology is often overlooked, but it's critical to societal functioning. My work directly impacted:
- Economic policy understanding ([Principal Economic Indicators](https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/home.htm))
- Accurate labor market insights ([Employment Situation Report](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm))
- Accessible data collection systems
- Improved government technology infrastructure

Each line of code contributed to something larger than myself‚Äîhelping measure and understand the economic pulse of the nation.

## What I Can Be Paid For: A Meaningful Career in Service of the Public ?

Contrary to popular belief, government technology offers more than just a steady paycheck. It provides:
- Opportunities for meaningful innovation
- Recognition for impactful work (like my Innovation Award üèÜ)
- A sense of contributing to the public good
- Professional growth and challenging projects

## The Intersection: My Ikigai

My ikigai emerged not from a single moment, but through years of work. By aligning my technical skills with a broader purpose, I transformed what could have been a routine job into a calling.

### Key Realizations
1. Purpose isn't found, it's created
2. Innovation can happen anywhere, even in bureaucratic systems
3. Technical skills are most powerful when applied with empathy and understanding

## A Message to Fellow Journeymen

Your ikigai might not be what/where you expect. Look for the intersection of your passion, skills, societal needs, and professional opportunities. 
Sometimes, it's hiding in plain sight‚Äîjust like my journey in government survey technology processing.

*So, maybe Ikigai is not a destination, but a continuous journey of alignment, purpose, and growth.*
