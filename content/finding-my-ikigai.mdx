# Finding My Ikigai: How Government Technology Became My Passion

## Understanding Ikigai

Ikigai is a Japanese concept that represents the intersection of four key elements:
- What you love
- What you're good at
- What the world needs
- What you can be paid for

My decade+ journey at the Bureau of Labor Statistics became an unexpected path to discovering my personal ikigai.

## What I Love: Technology and Problem-Solving

From the beginning, I was interested in Tech / Computers , driven by a desire to find solutions to  problems. 
I didn't exactly know where/how I could fit in into the world. But that was the directed I wanted to take. Some of the projects which I worked on weren't just technical challenges—they were opportunities to transform complicated processes into intuitive experiences.

## What I'm Good At: Software Engineering and Innovation

My skills went beyond coding. I excelled at:
- Understanding complex workflow needs
- Designing user-friendly interfaces
- Creating scalable, flexible systems
- Bridging technology with human needs

The IDCF Suite of applications perfectly exemplified this—we didn't just build a tool, we reimagined how survey management could work.

## What the World Needs: Reliable Public Infrastructure

Government technology is often overlooked, but it's critical to societal functioning. My work directly impacted:
- Economic policy understanding
- Accurate labor market insights
- Accessible data collection systems
- Improved government technology infrastructure

Each line of code contributed to something larger than myself—helping measure and understand the economic pulse of the nation.

## What I Can Be Paid For: A Meaningful Career in Service of the Public ?

Contrary to popular belief, government technology offers more than just a steady paycheck. It provides:
- Opportunities for meaningful innovation
- Recognition for impactful work (like my Innovation Awards)
- A sense of contributing to the public good
- Professional growth and challenging projects

## The Intersection: My Ikigai

My ikigai emerged not from a single moment, but through years of work. By aligning my technical skills with a broader purpose, I transformed what could have been a routine job into a calling.

### Key Realizations
1. Purpose isn't found, it's created
2. Innovation can happen anywhere, even in bureaucratic systems
3. Technical skills are most powerful when applied with empathy and understanding

## A Message to Fellow Journeymen

Your ikigai might not be where you expect. Look for the intersection of your passion, skills, societal needs, and professional opportunities. Sometimes, it's hiding in plain sight—just like my journey in government technology.

*Ikigai is not a destination, but a continuous journey of alignment, purpose, and growth.*
